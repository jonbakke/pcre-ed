# GNU ed with PCRE2 regular expressions for macOS
This script will:

1. ask `brew` to install `pcre2`
1. use `curl` or `wget` to download the source for GNU `ed` 1.16
1. patch, configure, build that source, and
1. copy the ed binary to a pcre-ed executable in the working directory.

## Why PCRE?
This project began after I read the manual page for macOS/BSD `ed` and wanted to use the word designators \\< and \\>. However, while these work on a GNU platform like my Debian box, it does not work on macOS because the regex library does not support that enhanced feature, GNU ed documentation notwithstanding.

PCRE2 regex forms are better, though, as one would expect. \\s is nicer than [[:blank:]], for instance.

## Why ed?
Three reasons, for now, for me:

Some people like vi because its command structure helps you move the cursor to the text you want to edit. Yes, it is better than holding down an arrow. However, ed doesn't even have a concept of "cursor" or "point," just "current line." I suspect using regular expressions to find the code I want to change will be even faster.

More importantly than speed, however, is mental focus. When I'm moving around in `ed`, I'm always thinking about the structure of the code. When I'm moving around in Xcode, I'm always thinking about the color and shape of the characters that represent the code. Surely, I will continue to use Xcode's autocomplete features when I'm working with Cocoa. But perhaps this experiment with `ed` will help me better grok the bases I'm trying to contribute to.

Finally, because I sometimes like having command-line context. Being able to perform my edits while reviewing my recent commands is quite nice for short notes like personal git commits.

## Not `ed`
Since PCRE expressions are not compatible with POSIX regex, it might cause problems to place a non-POSIX-compatible `ed` executable in $PATH. On my machines, I'm calling this program `ped` (to complement my `led`, which uses `ped` cooperatively with `less`.)
